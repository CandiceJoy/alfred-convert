Currency conversion:
	- Alter workflow so currencies are loaded from cache if it exists, and updated in the background.
		Currently, it's possible that currencies will never be loaded if there's no Internet connection.
		To fix this, load existing cached data and trigger background update to cached file with or without updating currently loaded data.
			- Test on McLovin without Internet connection

Deployment:
	- Replace symlinked workflow directory with copy of package
